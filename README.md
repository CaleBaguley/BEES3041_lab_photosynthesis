## Lab: Modelling the photosynthetic response to environmental conditions

### 10:00 am - 12:00 pm, 14th June, 2019 (T2)

In this lab we will explore a leaf-level photosynthesis model (Farquhar et al. 1980), which is central to all land schemes embedded in coupled-climate models.

In this practical we are going to:

* to learn about how leaf-level photosynthesis, responds to changes in the environmental forcing (photosynthetically active radiation, temperature and carbon dioxide).
* we are going to apply this model to ecosystem-scale (~1 km^2) meteorological data and explore how well a leaf-level model can predict fluxes at a larger spatial scale.
* we are going to use our new insights to consider the key assumptions we are making with our model and identify the key weaknesses in our approach.


### Running on your own computer

To run the practical:

1. Download or clone the entire repository, either:
    - Download the repository as a zip file, and uncompress it.
    - `git clone https://github.com/mdekauwe/BEES3041_lab_photosynthesis.git`
2. Then open up the [project file](BEES3041_lab.Rproj) in the repository folder in RStudio.
