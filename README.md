## Lab: Modelling the photosynthetic response to environmental conditions

### 10:00 am - 12:00 pm, 14th June, 2019 (T2)

In this lab we will explore a leaf-level photosynthesis model (Farquhar et al. 1980), which is central to all land schemes embedded in coupled climate models. We will explore how the rate of photosynthesis changes in responses to the environment: photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2). We will use this understanding to make predictions about the vegetation will response  to global change.

### Running on your own computer

To run the practical:

1. Download or clone the entire repository, either (hint, do b):
        a. Download the repository as a zip file, and uncompress it
        b.`git clone https://github.com/mdekauwe/BEES3041_lab_photosynthesis.git`
2. Then open up the project file in the repository folder in RStudio (`rstudio BEES3041_lab.Rproj`)
