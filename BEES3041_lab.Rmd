# Introduction

In this lab we will explore a leaf-level photosynthesis model (Farquhar et al. 1980), which is central to all land schemes embedded in coupled-climate models.

In this practical we are going to:

* to learn about how leaf-level photosynthesis, responds to changes in the environmental forcing (photosynthetically active radiation, temperature and carbon dioxide).
* we are going to apply this model to ecosystem-scale (~1 km^2) driving data and explore how well a leaf-level model can predict fluxes at a larger spatial scale.
* we are going to use our new insights to think consider the key assumptions we're making with this model and identify the key weaknesses in our approach.
