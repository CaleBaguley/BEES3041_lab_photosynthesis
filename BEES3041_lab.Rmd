# Introduction

In this lab we will explore a leaf-level photosynthesis model (Farquhar et al. 1980), which is central to all land schemes embedded in coupled climate models. We will explore how the rate of photosynthesis changes in responses to the environment: photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), temperature and carbon dioxide (CO~2~). We will use this understanding to make predictions about the vegetation will respons to global change.
