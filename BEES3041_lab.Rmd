# Introduction

In this lab we are going to explore the C~3~ leaf-level photosynthesis model proposed by Farquhar et al. (1980) and use this to simulate photosynthesis at leaf, ecosystem and global scales. The model is central to all land schemes embedded in coupled-climate models and predicts that photosynthesis is limited by the slowest of three biochemical processes: 

  1. Maximum rate of Rubisco-catalysed carboxylation
  2. Rate of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration via electron transport 
  3. The rate of RuBP regeneration via triose phosphate utilisation 

In this practical we are only going to consider the first two limitations. 

We are going to use this model to:

* learn how leaf-level photosynthesis responds to changes in the environmental forcing (photosynthetically active radiation, temperature and carbon dioxide).
* simulate GPP at the ecosystem-scale (~1 km^2) using FLUXNET (eddy covariance) meteorological data.
* simulate a global estimate of GPP.

From playing with this model across scales, we should start to see the key assumptions that our model makes. We should also begin to identify the key weakness in our approach as we apply the model at different scales.

# Temperature responses of model parameters

Let's start by exploring the response of the model to temperature. First we need to generate some temperature data:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

source("R/photosynthesis.R")
source("R/parameters.R")
source("R/constants.R")

Tleaf <- seq(0.0, 50.0, 0.5) + DEG_2_KELVIN
```

The photosynthesis model has two major parameters, the potential rate of electron
transport (Jmax) and the maximum rate of Rubisco activity (Vcmax). Both of these parameters vary as a function of temperature, let's plot them. I've copied the function calls from photosynthes.R:

```{r}
Vcmax <- peaked_arrh(p$Vcmax25, p$Eav, Tleaf, p$deltaSv, p$Hdv)
Jmax <- peaked_arrh(p$Jmax25, p$Eaj, Tleaf, p$deltaSj, p$Hdj)

df <- data.frame(Tleaf, Vcmax, Jmax)

ggplot(df, aes(Tleaf-DEG_2_KELVIN)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=Vcmax, colour="Vcmax")) +
  geom_line(aes(y=Jmax, colour="Jmax")) +
  ylab(expression("Paramater" ~ (mu * mol ~  m^{-2}  ~  s^{-1}))) +
  xlab(expression('Temperature ('*~degree*C*')')) + 
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.title=element_blank()) +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set2")
```

In the model both parameters are modelled using a peaked form of the Arrhenius equation. The Eav/Eaj parameters give the exponential increase of the function below the optimum; the Hdv/Hdj parameters describe the rate of decrease of the function above the optimum. 

Let's see what values we used:  

```{r}
print(c(p$Vcmax25, p$Eav, p$deltaSv, p$Hdv))
print(c(p$Jmax25, p$Eaj, p$deltaSj, p$Hdj))
```

Let's tweak these values and see how our functions respond to temperature

```{r}
Vcmax <- peaked_arrh(p$Vcmax25, p$Eav, Tleaf, p$deltaSv, p$Hdv)
Vcmax2 <- peaked_arrh(p$Vcmax25, 40000, Tleaf, 620.0, p$Hdv)
Vcmax3 <- peaked_arrh(p$Vcmax25, 70000, Tleaf, 650.0, p$Hdv)


df <- data.frame(Tleaf, Vcmax, Jmax)

ggplot(df, aes(Tleaf-DEG_2_KELVIN)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=Vcmax, colour="Vcmax")) +
  geom_line(aes(y=Vcmax2, colour="Vcmax2")) +
  geom_line(aes(y=Vcmax3, colour="Vcmax3")) +
  ylab(expression("Vcmax" ~ (mu * mol ~  m^{-2}  ~  s^{-1}))) +
  xlab(expression('Temperature ('*~degree*C*')')) + 
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.title=element_blank()) +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set2")
```

In the model, the Rubisco-limited photosynthesis rate is made up of five paramaters: 

  1. $\Gamma$$^{*}$: the CO~2~ compensation point in the absence of mitochondrial respiration.
  2. V~cmax~: the maximum rate of Rubisco activity.
  3. R~d~: leaf mitochondrial respiration in the light (day respiration).
  4. K~o~: Michaelis– Menten coefficients for oxygenation.
  5. K~c~: Michaelis– Menten coefficients for carboxylation.
  
Each of these parameters is temperature dependent, thus the skill of the model depends on correctly accounting for these response to temperature when using the model. When we use these model parameters in global models we typical assume that the parameters (excluding V~cmax~) are conserved across species. This assumption is broadly supported by observations, but what do we think happens in different growing conditions? By contrast, leaf measurements suggest that V~cmax~ varies considerably: varying between leaves within a single plant, across growing seasons and across plants. In global models, we typically assume that we can represent this variability using 5-11 plant functional types, see Rogers, A. Photosynth Res (2014) 119: 15. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11120-013-9818-1 for more details. Even when we do this in models, the disagreement across models is striking.

```{r rogers, echo=FALSE, out.width = '40%', fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("data/rogers.png")
```

Now that you've seen how to call the functions to calculate V~cmax~ and J~max~, can you look in the code (R/photosynthesis.R) and also plot $\Gamma$$^{*}$, R~d~m, K~o~ and K~m~ as a function of temperature?

# Response to temperature

From this understanding of how the key model parameters change with temperature, can we make a prediction about how the rate of photosynthesis is likely to change with temperature? 

Let's make a plot to see if our predictions matched the models...

```{r}
Tleaf <- seq(0, 50.0, 0.5) + DEG_2_KELVIN
PAR <- 1800.0
Cs <- 400.0
vpd <- 1.5

out <- calc_photosynthesis(p, Tleaf, PAR, Cs, vpd, peaked_Vcmax=TRUE,
                           peaked_Jmax=TRUE)
df <- data.frame(Tleaf, out$An, out$Ac, out$Aj)

ggplot(df, aes(Tleaf-DEG_2_KELVIN)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=out.Ac, colour="Rubisco-limited (Ac)")) +
  geom_line(aes(y=out.Aj, colour="RuBP-limited (Aj)")) +
  ylab(expression("Photosynthesis" ~ (mu * mol ~  m^{-2}  ~  s^{-1}))) +
  xlab(expression('Temperature ('*~degree*C*')')) + 
  #theme_classic(base_size=16) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.title=element_blank()) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.9, 0.9)) +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set2")

#if (dir.exists("plots") == FALSE) {
#  dir.create("plots")
#}
#ggsave("plots/Ac_Aj_temp.pdf", width=9, height=6) 
```

The plot shows the response of A to temperature increases steadily until it reaches an optimum point (T~opt~), after which A declines at a faster rate.

The model assumes that the Rubisco-limited assimilation rate follows a Michaelis–Menten response function, accounting for a competitive inhibitor, oxygen. With Michaelis-Menten reactions, increasing the limiting substrate, CO~2~, the amount of enzyme present, Rubisco, or decreasing the competitive inhibitor, O2, will yield higher reaction rates. The model also assumes that the RuBP regeneration-limited rate of assimilation depends on the rate at which the light reactions generate ATP and NADPH; this process is limited at low light intensity. 

Let's demonstrate this is the case by reducing and increasing the intercellular concentration of O2 parameter and plotting the impact. Rubisco catalyses the oxygenation of RuBP as well as carboxylation, although the affinity for oxygen is lower than that for CO~2~. 

```{r}
Tleaf <- seq(0, 50.0, 0.5) + DEG_2_KELVIN
PAR <- 1800.0
Cs <- 400.0
vpd <- 1.5

p$Oi = 210.0
out_std <- calc_photosynthesis(p, Tleaf, PAR, Cs, vpd, peaked_Vcmax=TRUE,
                               peaked_Jmax=TRUE)

p$Oi = 150.0
out_low <- calc_photosynthesis(p, Tleaf, PAR, Cs, vpd, peaked_Vcmax=TRUE,
                               peaked_Jmax=TRUE)
p$Oi = 300.0
out_high <- calc_photosynthesis(p, Tleaf, PAR, Cs, vpd, peaked_Vcmax=TRUE,
                               peaked_Jmax=TRUE)

df<- data.frame(Tleaf, out_low$An, out_std$An, out_high$An)

ggplot(df, aes(Tleaf-DEG_2_KELVIN)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=out_low.An, colour="150")) +
  geom_line(aes(y=out_std.An, colour="210")) +
  geom_line(aes(y=out_high.An, colour="250")) +
  ylab(expression("Photosynthesis" ~ (mu * mol ~  m^{-2}  ~  s^{-1}))) +
  xlab(expression('Temperature ('*~degree*C*')')) + 
  #theme_classic(base_size=16) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.title=element_blank()) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.9, 0.9)) +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set2")
```
Can you work out how to test the factors two?

***

## Response to PAR

At low PAR, A is RUBP regeneration-limited due to the low rates of electron transport. The slope of the inital portion of the A/PAR curve is referred to as the quantum efficieicy of CO~2~ assimilation (see alpha parameter). As light increases, the rapid increase of A with PAR begins to diminsh. The rate this occurs at depends on what we assumed for the curvuture parameter (theta_J). 

Let's make a plot of A as a function of PAR, can you see figure out how to explore the sensitivity of A to alpha and theta_J?

```{r}
Tleaf <- 25.0 + DEG_2_KELVIN
PAR <- seq(0, 2000.0, 0.5) 
Cs <- 400.0
vpd <- 1.5

out <- calc_photosynthesis(p, Tleaf, PAR, Cs, vpd, peaked_Vcmax=TRUE,
                           peaked_Jmax=TRUE)
df <- data.frame(PAR, out$An, out$Ac, out$Aj, out$Rd)



#if (dir.exists("plots") == FALSE) {
#  dir.create("plots")
#}
#ggsave("plots/An_PAR.pdf", width=9, height=6) 
```
***

## Response to CO~2~

At low [CO~2~] concentrations, photosynthesis is Rubisco-limited except for when PAR is also low. With inceasing [CO~2~], A increases until an inflection point is reached where A is said to be co-limited by Rubisco and RuBP regeneration. 

```{r}
Tleaf <- 25.0 + DEG_2_KELVIN
PAR <- 1800.0
Cs <- seq(100., 1000, 0.5) 
vpd <- 1.5

out <- calc_photosynthesis(p, Tleaf, PAR, Cs, vpd, peaked_Vcmax=TRUE,
                           peaked_Jmax=TRUE)
df <- data.frame(Cs, out$An, out$Ac, out$Aj, out$Rd)

ggplot(df, aes(Cs)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=out.Ac - out.Rd, colour="Ac"), size=1.0) +
  geom_line(aes(y=out.Aj - out.Rd, colour="Aj"), size=1.0) +
  geom_line(aes(y=out.An, color="An"), size=1.0) +
  ylab(expression("Photosynthesis" ~ (mu * mol ~  m^{-2}  ~  s^{-1}))) +
  xlab(expression('Ca' ~ (mu * mol ~ mol^{-1}))) +
  #theme_classic(base_size=16) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.title=element_blank()) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.1, 0.9)) +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set2")

#if (dir.exists("plots") == FALSE) {
#  dir.create("plots")
#}
#ggsave("plots/An_CO2.pdf", width=9, height=6)  
```

## Response to global change

The plots you've made should have given you some insight into how A will respond to changes in temperature and [CO~2~]. This is very powerful as it means you should now have a good sense of what a climate model will simulate will happen to GPP in the future.

You can probably also make an informed guess about some of the factors that we haven't accounted for in this model. For example, what happens to photosynthesis in a drought? What happens as the ozone concentration changes? The model predicts and instantaneous response to temperature but what about acclimation to temperature? 

***

## Flux stuff

Let's now apply the leaf-level model at a coarser spatial scale and compare our model simulations to measured data. In doing so, try and keep in mind the assumptions we are making. Can we explain any model-data disagreements based on these?

To apply the leaf-level model at a km^2^ scale, we are going to use a big-leaf approximation to scale up our leaf-level model. We are going to assume that:

$$APAR = PAR * fPAR$$

where 

$$fPAR = 1.0 - exp(-k * LAI)) / k$$
and k=0.5.

Across the globe there is large network of sites (>200) with meteorological sensors measuring a range of variables (e.g. temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall) on a continuous basis. At each of these sites, the eddy covariance method is also used to measure fluxes of carbon dioxide and water vapour exchanged between the vegetation and soils and the atmosphere. These data are freely avaliable at a number of sites (but not all!) under a release called FLUXNET2015 (https://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/).

Explain about GPP

Explain about netcdf

## Global predictions

Can we build a simple global map of GPP with some simple assumptions....























Let's get some CO2 data to run the model with

```{r}
mauna_loa_co2 <- read.table('ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2_annmean_mlo.txt')
names(mauna_loa_co2) <- c('year', 'co2ppm', 'unc')

ggplot(mauna_loa_co2, aes(year, co2ppm)) +
  geom_line() +
  ylab("CO2 (ppm)") +
  xlab('Year') + 
  theme_classic()
```
